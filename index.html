		<comment>Abstract:</comment>
		This paper identifies a negative horizontal spillover of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) built in China and analyzes their localized effects on firm productivity, 
		wages, and labor market competition. The study shows both empirically and theoretically that labor market competition is responsible for the negative spillover 
		effect. With positive assortative matching between workers' skill and firms' technology, SEZs shift the zone firm's productivity upwards, increase wages. This 
		results in a negative effect on non-zone firms. Consequently, there is an overall positive welfare gain from SEZs, with welfare gain for zone firms and welfare 
		loss for non-zone firms. The analysis provides caveats in analyzing the SEZ policy in terms of welfare distribution and firm performance in many developing countries.

			<comment>Abstract:</comment>
			Based on 2013 China Household finance Survey data, this study examines: first, the labor income gaps
			between rural and urban individuals in China, and second, the financial market participation of Chinese
			households in investment products and loans. It applies an extended model of the gap decomposition
			method among rural and urban dwellers to study the determinants of individual labor income inequality. 
			The decomposition results support the hypothesis that the difference occurs because of gaps in human capital 
			measured by education and occupation. At the household level, the Chinese financial market participation rate is 
			found to be determined by household income, household size, sufficient knowledge of financial products, and the 
			availability and convenience of financial services. This study confirms rural-urban inequality that urban households 
			have a higher rate of participation in financial markets. Household income, available and convenient financial
			services, and sufficient knowledge of financial products positively affect financial market participation in China. 
			This paper contributes to the existing literature by using the China Household Finance Survey data to study the rural-urban 
			inequality of both income and wealth in China.
